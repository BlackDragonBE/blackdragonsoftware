			information.
		</p>

		<p>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

		<p>In Short: We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention,
			and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.

			interest, such as to prevent harm.
		</p>

		<p>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

		<p>In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do
			so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual
			obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.
		</p>

		<p>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>

		<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your
			personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information: Consent. We may process your
			information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your
			consent at any time. Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for
			compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal
			rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. Vital Interests. We may process your information where
			we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential
			threats to the safety of any person.
		</p>

		<p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>

		<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
			purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. 
		</p>

		<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for
			example: If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way For investigations and fraud
			detection and prevention For business transactions provided certain conditions are met If it is contained in a witness statement and the
			collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating
			with next of kin If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse If it is reasonable to
			expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for
			purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province If disclosure is required to
			comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records If it was produced by an individual in
			the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was
			produced If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes If the information is publicly available and is specified
			by the regulations
		</p>

		<p>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>

		<p>In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>

			retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).
		</p>

		<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or,
			if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
			personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
		</p>

		<p>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

		<p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

		<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
			information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
			information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
			unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although

			activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
			uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
